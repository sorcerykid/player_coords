Player Coords Mod v1.0
By Leslie Krause

Player Coords is an esy-to-use debugging tool for game developers to record player
movement via a dedicated log file. It is intended for singleplayer, but can also prove
useful in multiplayer (the "server" privilege is required).

The results are output to the "coords.txt" file in the world directory. Hence, you can
use the "tail -f" command to observe player movement from a secondary terminal window.
